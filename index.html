							<br><br><br><h2> About Me</h2>
							<p> As a child, I had always hosted the dream of someday owning Disney World; however, life never goes totally according to plan. Eventually, I came to find a passion for helping people as well as a longing to follow in my mentor's footsteps and become a surgeon. After developing such passions, I decided that biomedical engineering is the direction for me, and this led me the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, where I am pursuing that passion which will allow me to eventually follow life's next path as I graduate on time from a four year B.S. program.<br><br>While I may never be the sole owner of the 'Happiest Place on Earth,' I can proudly say I hold one share of stock in the Walt Disney Company. I also enjoy spending my recreational time with friends and family and pursuing my hobbies of water & winter sports, unicycling, and photography. <br><br> Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn.</p>
