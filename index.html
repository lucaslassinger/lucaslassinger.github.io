							<br><br><br><h2> About Me</h2>
							<p> As a child, I always hosted the dream of someday owning Disney World; however, life never goes totally according to plan. Eventually, I came to find a passion for helping people as well as a longing to follow in my mentor's footsteps and become a surgeon. After developing such passions, I decided that biomedical engineering was the direction for me, and this led me to the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, where I pursued that passion. <br><br> Since graduating from UB in May 2021, I have continued to my Masters Degree program at the University of Rochester in their Center for Medical Technology and Innovation Biomedical Engineering program. In this program I am spending my time shadowing surgeries; interacting with clinicians, school faculty, and other hospital and school staff; and identifying and developing devices around clinical needs. My education will guide me as I follow life's next path and fulfill my mission of designing medical devices that improve patient outcomes and ultimately help save lives.<br><br>While I may never be the sole owner of the 'Happiest Place on Earth,' I can proudly say I hold one share of stock in the Walt Disney Company. I also enjoy spending my recreational time with friends and family and pursuing my hobbies of water & winter sports, photography, and 3D printing. <br><br>
