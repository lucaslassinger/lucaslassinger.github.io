							<br><br><br><h2> About Me</h2>
							<p> As a child, I always hosted the dream of someday owning Disney World; however, life never goes totally according to plan. Eventually, I came to find a passion for helping people as well as a longing to follow in my mentor's footsteps and become a surgeon. After developing such passions, I decided that biomedical engineering was the direction for me, and this led me to the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, and later the University of Rochester Center for Medical Technology and Innovation, where I pursued that passion. <br><br> Since graduating from my degree programs, I have entered the start-up world as a R&D Engineer at Med Dimensions in Rochester, NY. It is my belief that anyone from engineers to medical professionals, business people to patients can help change the face of medicine. I plan follow life's path and aim to inspire others as a means of fulfilling my mission to improve patient outcomes and ultimately help save lives.<br><br>While I may never be the sole owner of the 'Happiest Place on Earth,' I can proudly say I hold one share of stock in the Walt Disney Company. I also enjoy spending my recreational time with friends and family and pursuing my hobbies of water & winter sports, photography, and 3D printing. <br><br>
